Revenue LY = CALCULATE([Total Revenue], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(sales[order_date]))
Revenue Growth % = DIVIDE([Total Revenue] - [Revenue LY], [Revenue LY])
```

### Customer Measures
```dax
New Customers = 
CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT(sales[customer_id]),
    FILTER(
        ALL(sales),
        sales[order_date] = 
        CALCULATE(MIN(sales[order_date]), ALLEXCEPT(sales, sales[customer_id]))
    )
)

Customer Lifetime Value = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(SUM(sales[total_amount]), ALL(sales[order_date])),
    DISTINCTCOUNT(sales[customer_id])
)
```

### Product Measures
```dax
Top Product by Revenue = 
CALCULATE(
    MAX(products[product_name]),
    TOPN(1, ALL(products), [Total Revenue], DESC)
)

Product Rank = RANKX(ALL(products[product_name]), [Total Revenue], , DESC)
