- **Exercise**: Understand table relationships (customers ‚Üí sales ‚Üê products)
- **Outcome**: Grasp database design principles

#### Day 5-7: Basic SQL Queries
- **Theory**: SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY
- **Practical**: Connect to database and run basic queries:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM customers LIMIT 10;
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales;
  SELECT product_name, price FROM products ORDER BY price DESC;
  ```
- **Outcome**: Comfortable with basic SQL syntax

---

### **Week 2: Intermediate SQL & Business Insights**

#### Day 8-10: JOINs and Relationships
- **Theory**: INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER JOINs

  ```sql
  -- Customer purchase history
  SELECT c.customer_name, s.order_date, p.product_name, s.quantity
  FROM customers c
  JOIN sales s ON c.customer_id = s.customer_id  
  JOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
  ORDER BY s.order_date DESC;
  ```
- **Outcome**: Link related data across tables

#### Day 11-12: Aggregations & Analytics  
- **Theory**: SUM, AVG, COUNT, GROUP BY, HAVING
- **Practical**: Business metrics calculations:
  ```sql
  -- Monthly sales revenue
  SELECT YEAR(order_date) as year, MONTH(order_date) as month,
         SUM(total_amount) as monthly_revenue
  FROM sales 
  GROUP BY YEAR(order_date), MONTH(order_date);
  ```
- **Outcome**: Extract business KPIs from raw data

#### Day 13-14: Views & Stored Procedures
- **Theory**: Reusable queries and database logic
- **Practical**: Create views for common business queries

- **Outcome**: Organize complex queries for reuse

---

### **Week 3: Advanced SQL & T-SQL Concepts**

#### Day 15-17: Window Functions & Advanced Analytics
- **Theory**: ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), LAG(), LEAD()
- **Practical**: Advanced business analytics:
  ```sql
  -- Customer ranking by purchase amount
  SELECT customer_name, total_spent,
         RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_spent DESC) as customer_rank
  FROM customer_summary_view;
  ```
- **Outcome**: Perform sophisticated data analysis

#### Day 18-19: T-SQL Compatibility
- **Theory**: Differences between MySQL SQL and T-SQL
- **Practical**: Compare `scripts/mysql/` vs `scripts/t-sql/`
- **Exercise**: Understand syntax variations
- **Outcome**: Write queries compatible with different systems

#### Day 20-21: Performance Optimization
- **Theory**: Indexes, query execution plans
- **Practical**: Analyze slow queries and optimize them
- **Exercise**: Create indexes for better performance
- **Outcome**: Write efficient, scalable queries

---

### **Week 4: Power BI Integration & Visualization**

#### Day 22-24: Power BI Basics
- **Theory**: Business Intelligence concepts
- **Practical**: Install Power BI Desktop and MySQL ODBC driver
- **Exercise**: Follow `powerbi/mysql_connection_guide.md`
- **Outcome**: Connect Power BI to your MySQL database

#### Day 25-26: Data Modeling in Power BI
- **Theory**: Star schema, relationships, measures
- **Practical**: Import tables and define relationships
- **Exercise**: Create calculated measures using DAX
- **Outcome**: Structured data model for analysis

#### Day 27-28: Dashboard Creation
- **Theory**: Visualization best practices
